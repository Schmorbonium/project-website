    title: "The 3-D BreakOut"
    text: "Our Project"
    body: "Our mission is to challenge the standard 2-dimensional circuit board design of traditional general-purpose computers and create a one-of-a-kind artistic expression that doubles as a physical demonstration of the often unseen and unknown internal workings of modern computing. We aim to inspire creativity, curiosity, and a deeper understanding of the intersection between technology and art, ultimately transforming our little corner of the world into a slightly more beautiful and intellectually aware place."
