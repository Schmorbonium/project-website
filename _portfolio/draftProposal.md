In the time leading up to turning in the first draft of our proposal, several decisions were made about our project. Some of the most relevant things include:

- Finding the official specification for RISC-V (which later turned out to be out of date)
- Deciding to implement the RV32E base implementation, to reduce the number of parts we need to purchase
- Looking into simulating our design using Verilog before building it
- Identifying the original software in our project as an interface for programming the CPU
- Discussion of what peripherals we could build (Isaac really wants to make a graphics co-processor again, and Daniel wants to make an LED grid)
