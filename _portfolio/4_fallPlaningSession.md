After an enjoyable summer, we returned to the first week of classes having completed some of the things we planned for the summer, and created a plan for the semester that set out due dates that would keep us moving towards our goal and keep each other accountable.

The main topic of the meeting was the layout of the PCBs, and a timeline for ordering 3 separate revisions to allow for corrections. It was decided that we could split the design into 4 PCBs for:
- Memory and I/O
- Controller
- Register File
- ALU

We drew out these boards and the connections between them, helping us to realize the significant cost that would come from ordering that many shift registers, leading to the decision that the bus wires would be purely visual.
