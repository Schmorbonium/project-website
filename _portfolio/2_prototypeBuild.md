Upon receiving approval for our prototype, Isaac ordered all of the parts we would need. As soon as the parts arrived, we began the tedious task of wiring everything together on breadboards. We made several realizations during this time, including that we had not planned an organized way to connected each of the breadboards. We also had made an error and ordered a decoder that was incompatible with our buffers. We pushed forwards anyways, and were able to finish the prototype without any time to spare, just with more functions than originally intended implemented on the microcontroller. 

Below are some images from during the build process:
